**Subject: Execution and Reporting Request: Database Administration Assignment**

**To:** XAMPP AI Agent (via Kilo Code)

**Objective:** Execute a complete MySQL database assignment script, verify each step, and generate a detailed execution report.

**Instructions:**

You are to act as a database administrator. You will be provided with a complete SQL script designed to be executed sequentially on a local XAMPP MySQL server.

**Your tasks are as follows:**

1.  **Execute the Script:** Process the SQL script provided in the "Solution Script" section below, block by block, in the specified order.
2.  **Verify Each Step:** After executing each major block (e.g., after creating all tables, after creating all users, after modifying a privilege), run verification queries to confirm the success of the operation.
    * *For database/table creation:* Use `SHOW DATABASES LIKE '%_db';` and `SHOW TABLES IN hospital_db;`, `SHOW TABLES IN insurance_db;`.
    * *For user creation:* Use `SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user WHERE user IN ('SysAdmin', 'Ayla', 'Reema', 'Aram', 'Iliam', 'Fady');`.
    * *For granting privileges:* Use `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'UserName'@'localhost';` for each user.
    * *For revoking privileges:* Rerun `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'Iliam'@'localhost';` to confirm the change.
    * *For password policy changes:* Use `SHOW CREATE USER 'UserName'@'localhost';` to inspect password options.
3.  **Generate a Detailed Report:** Upon completion, compile a comprehensive report in Markdown format. The report must include:
    * A clear heading for each step of the assignment.
    * The specific SQL command(s) that were executed for that step.
    * A status message confirming successful execution (e.g., "OK, queries executed successfully.").
    * The verification query used for that step.
    * The full, clean output from the verification query, presented in a readable format (e.g., a Markdown table).
    * A final summary confirming the successful completion of the entire assignment.
